Lab2
Requirements:
1)Input
    Stream of characters
    CFG(Combination of CFGs of some classes of sentences)
2)Output
    Sequence of derivations if top-down syntax analyzing methods are used.
    Sequence of reductions if bottom-up syntax analyzing methods are used.
3)Classes of sentences are defined by yourself
4)Error handling may be included
Methods:
1)LL(1)
   a)Construct LL(1) parsing table based on the CFG
   b)Design the program using LL(1) paring table
2)LR(1)
   a)Construct LR(1) parsing table based on the CFG
   b)Design the program using LR(1) paring table
3) Generating programs based on your own YACC
